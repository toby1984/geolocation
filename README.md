Uses
----

1.) http://www.jhlabs.com/java/maps/proj/ for map projection
2.) Map images from WikiMedia Commons
3.) IP geolocation REST API from http://freegeoip.net/

Building
--------

I couldn't find a working Maven artifact for the "proj" library so I built it from the SVN trunk sources at sourceforge and included in the /lib folder. 

Run

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=lib/jmapprojlib-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -DgroupId=com.jhlabs -DartifactId=javaproj -Dversion=1.0-tgierke -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true -DcreateChecksum=true

to install the file in your local repository.

Afterwards, just run "mvn package" (which creates a self-executable JAR "target/geolocation.jar") or "mvn compile exec:java" to run it.
